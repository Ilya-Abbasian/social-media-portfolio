          <h2>Adoption, Donations & Volunteers – A Full-Funnel Social Campaign</h2>
          <p>
            This portfolio presents my social media strategy and ad designs for <strong>Heal Animal Rescue</strong>.
            The goal of this project is to increase pet adoptions, grow sustainable donations, and build a consistent
            brand presence that reflects compassion, trust, and community. Below, you’ll find an overview of the
            campaign, detailed strategy, visual ad mockups, and a short explanation of my creative process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of this site as both a <strong>documentation space</strong> and a <strong>storytelling hub</strong>:
            it walks through the logic behind key decisions, demonstrates how the visuals support the brand, and
            shows how all the components fit together into a cohesive, professional campaign that I could confidently
            share with potential employers and collaborators.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project focuses on building a social media advertising campaign for an animal rescue nonprofit.
          The primary objectives are to increase pet adoptions, generate recurring donations, and encourage more
          people to volunteer their time. To achieve this, I developed a clear brand voice, a set of visual
          guidelines, and three ad concepts designed specifically for Meta platforms (Facebook & Instagram).
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, I outline the core <strong>goals, audience, and key messages</strong>. The campaign
          targets individuals who love animals, have the financial or emotional capacity to adopt or donate, and
          value transparency from nonprofits. I prioritized a warm, hopeful tone, simple calls to action, and
          imagery that highlights real animals and real stories. Rather than just asking for help, the campaign
          aims to show the <em>impact</em> of every adoption, donation, and volunteer hour.

        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>Audience & Platforms</h3>
            <p>
              The campaign is designed primarily for <strong>Meta (Facebook & Instagram)</strong>, which allows
              for interest-based, behavioral, and location-specific targeting. The core demographic segment includes
              adults aged 18–45 living within driving distance of the rescue, who show interests in pets, animal
              welfare, and local community organizations. Additional targeting layers can include engagement with
              similar nonprofits and previous donors.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Creative & Messaging Choices</h3>
            <p>
              Each of the three ads focuses on a different action: <strong>Adoption Spotlight</strong>, 
              <strong>Holiday Donation Appeal</strong>, and <strong>Volunteer Recruitment</strong>. The visuals
              use a consistent color palette, typography, and logo placement to reinforce brand recognition.
              Captions balance emotional storytelling with clear calls to action like “Adopt Today,” “Give Monthly,”
              or “Volunteer With Us.” Together, these choices align with the organization’s mission while creating
              a cohesive, professional brand presence.

        <h2>Process & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I approached this project as both a designer and strategist. I began by clarifying the organization’s
          objectives, then created a simple content framework that connects each ad to a specific goal and action.
          From there, I sketched low-fidelity concepts, refined them into digital mockups, and iterated based on
          feedback about clarity, accessibility, and tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the process, I paid attention to accessibility: using legible type, high contrast between text
          and background, and alt text to describe visuals for screen-reader users. I also considered how the ads
          would appear on mobile devices, where most users interact with social platforms. This section is meant
          to show not just the final visuals, but the <strong>thinking behind them</strong> and how I would apply
          that thinking to future campaigns and real-world client work.
