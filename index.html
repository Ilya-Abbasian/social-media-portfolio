          <h2>Heal Animal Rescue: Social Media Strategy &amp; Advertising Campaign</h2>
          <p>
            This portfolio presents my social media strategy and ad designs for <strong>Heal Animal Rescue</strong>.
            The campaign is a digital-first approach to increase adoptions, grow sustainable donations, and recruit
            more volunteers while strengthening brand awareness across platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site mirrors my pitch presentation and is divided into sections for the organization overview,
            campaign goals, audience and platform strategy, content and ad concepts, accessibility and crisis
            planning, budget and KPIs, and a sample content calendar and competitor analysis. It ends with a gallery
            of visuals and a reflection on what I would build next.

    <!-- OVERVIEW SECTION -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project focuses on building a social media advertising campaign for an animal rescue nonprofit.
          The primary objectives are to increase pet adoptions, generate recurring donations, and encourage more
          people to volunteer their time. To achieve this, I developed a clear brand voice, a set of visual
          guidelines, and several ad concepts designed for Meta platforms (Facebook &amp; Instagram).
        </p>
        <p>
          The portfolio acts as both documentation and storytelling. It explains how I translated the organization’s
          mission into concrete goals, built a strategy around the audience’s needs, and chose tactics that make
          sense for a small nonprofit with limited resources but a highly engaged community.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>About Heal Animal Rescue</h2>
        <p>
          Heal Animal Rescue is a Western Pennsylvania–based nonprofit focused on rescuing, rehabilitating, and
          rehoming animals while educating the community about responsible pet care. They rely heavily on donations,
          volunteers, and word-of-mouth support to keep daily operations running and to give each animal the time
          and care it deserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rescue uses social media as a primary communication channel, but like many small organizations it
          faces challenges: limited time, inconsistent posting, and competing priorities between adoption promotion,
          fundraising, and volunteer outreach. My strategy aims to bring structure to that mix and help their
          channels work together in a more intentional way.

    <!-- CAMPAIGN GOALS -->
    <section id="goals" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Campaign Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The campaign goals are based on the organization’s real needs and the opportunities available through
          digital platforms. They balance immediate actions (adoptions and donations) with longer-term brand health.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase adoptions by highlighting individual animals and simplifying the next steps.</li>
          <li>Grow one-time and recurring donations with clear impact-driven messaging.</li>
          <li>Recruit volunteers by showing how people can contribute time, not just money.</li>
          <li>Strengthen brand awareness so Heal feels familiar, trustworthy, and recognizable.</li>
          <li>Improve engagement across platforms with more consistent, story-driven content.</li>

    <!-- AUDIENCE & PLATFORMS -->
    <section id="audience-platforms" class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Target Audience &amp; Platform Strategy</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>Target Audience Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The campaign targets three main groups: potential pet adopters, local families looking to support
              animal welfare, and volunteers ranging from teens to adults. These audiences are united by a love of
              animals, interest in local community work, and a desire to see their support make a direct impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within each group, there are different levels of readiness—from people casually following cute animals
              online to those actively searching for a pet or cause to support. The content mix is designed to meet
              each group where they are and gently move them toward adoption, donation, or volunteering.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Platform Focus</h3>
            <p>
              I prioritized <strong>Meta (Facebook &amp; Instagram)</strong> as the core platforms because of their
              strong local reach, event tools, and robust advertising options. Organic posts build community and
              share ongoing stories, while paid ads help promote high-priority needs like long-stay animals or
              seasonal fundraising campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other platforms such as TikTok or YouTube Shorts can support future growth with more video storytelling,
              but the initial strategy focuses on doing a few platforms well instead of spreading the team too thin.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- CONTENT & ADS -->
    <section id="content-ads" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Content &amp; Ad Strategy</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>Brand Voice &amp; Visual Direction</h3>
            <p>
              The brand voice is warm, hopeful, and honest. Posts use clear, simple language and focus on real
              animals and real people instead of overly polished marketing speak. Visually, the campaign uses
              consistent colors, typography, and logo placement so that posts and ads are instantly recognizable
              as coming from Heal Animal Rescue.
            </p>
            <p>
              This consistency builds trust and makes it easier for followers to recognize Heal in a crowded feed.
              It also gives volunteers and staff a framework to follow when creating new posts or stories.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Ad Concepts Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The paid ad strategy is built around three core concepts: an <strong>Adoption Spotlight</strong> that
              features a specific animal, a <strong>Holiday Donation Appeal</strong> that taps into seasonal giving,
              and a <strong>Volunteer Recruitment</strong> ad that highlights the impact of volunteer work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each concept pairs strong visuals with a single, clear call to action and links directly to the
              appropriate landing page—adoption information, donation form, or volunteer sign-up—reducing friction
              for users who are ready to act.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- ACCESSIBILITY & CRISIS -->
    <section id="accessibility-crisis" class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Accessibility &amp; Crisis Plan</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>Accessibility &amp; Inclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout the campaign, I prioritize accessibility: high-contrast text and backgrounds, readable
              font sizes, descriptive alt text for images, and simple layouts that work well on mobile. Captions
              are written to be understandable without complex jargon, and key information like event dates or
              adoption requirements is repeated clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The content also aims to be inclusive by highlighting a variety of animals and adopters, and by
              avoiding language that could unintentionally shame people who cannot adopt or donate but still want
              to help.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Crisis Plan Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The crisis plan outlines how Heal would respond to urgent situations, such as an animal health
              emergency, negative publicity, or sudden facility issues. It identifies who should approve messaging,
              what channels to use first, and how to keep the community informed without causing panic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to communicate quickly, honestly, and compassionately, while reinforcing the organization’s
              values and maintaining trust with supporters.

        <h3>Competitor Analysis Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Competitor research focused on rescues and animal nonprofits in Pennsylvania and nationwide. Key themes:
          many organizations excel in emotional storytelling but lack consistent CTAs or structured volunteer
          recruiting content. Others run strong ads but lack human-focused community connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          This campaign blends both strengths—high-emotion content and clear next steps—to create a more effective
          and actionable social media presence.

        <h2>Process &amp; Strategic Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
          I approached this project as both a designer and strategist. I began by clarifying the organization’s
          objectives, then created a simple framework that connects each ad and content stream back to those
          goals. From there, I sketched low-fidelity concepts, refined them into digital mockups, and iterated
          based on feedback about clarity, accessibility, and tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, key opportunities include more video content, stronger volunteer storytelling, and
          ongoing adoption success stories that close the loop for the audience. Seasonal mini-campaigns and
          deeper community partnerships could help Heal Animal Rescue keep scaling its impact while staying
          true to its grassroots feel.
